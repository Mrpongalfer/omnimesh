## üîí **Security Architecture**

### Defense-in-Depth Strategy

Our security model implements multiple layers of protection:

#### 1. Network Security

- **TLS 1.3**: Latest encryption protocols
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security headers
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchange

#### 2. Application Security

- **Content Security Policy Level 3**: Prevent XSS and code injection
- **Subresource Integrity**: Verify asset authenticity
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server and client-side validation

#### 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP, WebAuthn, biometrics
- **Zero-Trust Model**: Verify every request regardless of source
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling with rotation

#### 4. Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256-GCM for stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware security modules (HSMs)
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data

#### 5. Runtime Security

- **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution environments
- **Memory Protection**: Address space layout randomization
- **Code Integrity**: Digital signatures and verification
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time threat monitoring

### Security Headers

All responses include security headers:

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}' 'strict-dynamic'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

## üß™ **Security Testing**

### Automated Security Scanning

We continuously monitor for vulnerabilities:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Daily npm audit and Snyk scans
- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL and ESLint security rules
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy and Clair vulnerability detection
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing in CI/CD
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing on staging

### Penetration Testing

- **Internal Testing**: Monthly security assessments
- **External Audits**: Quarterly third-party penetration tests
- **Bug Bounty**: Public bug bounty program (coming Q2 2025)
- **Red Team**: Annual red team exercises

### Security Metrics

We track the following security KPIs:

- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: < 15 minutes
- **Mean Time to Response (MTTR)**: < 1 hour for critical issues
- **Vulnerability Backlog**: Zero high/critical open vulnerabilities
- **Patch Cycle**: 99% of vulnerabilities patched within SLA

---

## üîç **Vulnerability Management**

### Classification System

We use CVSS 3.1 scoring with the following severity levels:

#### Critical (9.0-10.0)

- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise
- Mass data exfiltration
- Authentication bypass

#### High (7.0-8.9)

- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure
- Service disruption
- Cross-site scripting (stored)

#### Medium (4.0-6.9)

- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (reflected)
- Cross-site request forgery
- Denial of service

#### Low (0.1-3.9)

- Minor information leakage
- Configuration issues
- Non-security bugs with security implications

### Patch Management

Our patch management process:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and exploitability
2. **Prioritization**: Schedule based on severity and exposure
3. **Development**: Implement fix with security review
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing in isolated environment
5. **Deployment**: Staged rollout with monitoring
6. **Verification**: Confirm fix effectiveness
7. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders and users
